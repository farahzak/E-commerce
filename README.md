## Introduction
In the fast-paced world of e-commerce, turning raw sales data into actionable insights is essential for competitive advantage. This project analyzes a synthetic dataset simulating an online retail business to uncover product performance, customer behavior, and regional demand patterns. The goal: to drive smarter inventory decisions, targeted marketing, and profitable product mix strategies.

## Objective
To answer key business questions through exploratory data analysis, including:
