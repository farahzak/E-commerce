## Introduction
In the fast-paced world of e-commerce, transforming raw sales data into actionable insights is essential for strategic decision-making. This project explores customer orders, regional sales trends, product performance, and pricing dynamics using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) to simulate the decision-making environment of a merchandising or allocation analyst.

## Objective
- Identify best-selling products and categories by quantity and revenue.
- Understand geographic demand patterns across U.S. cities.
- Uncover seasonal trends and performance dips.
- Explore how product price relates to customer purchase behavior.
- Reveal bundling and product association opportunities.

## Key Insights

### üìç Geographic Sales Distribution
- **San Francisco**, **Los Angeles**, and **New York** are not only the most active markets by order count ‚Äî they also generate higher average revenue per order.
- Smaller cities like **Austin** and **Denver** show consistent volume but lower margins, suggesting discount sensitivity or different product demand.

### üõçÔ∏è Top-Selling Products & Categories
- The top 10 products contribute **over 40% of all sales revenue**, indicating a high concentration of demand.
- Some high-revenue products have **lower quantity but higher price points**, suggesting a niche but profitable product strategy.

### üìà Monthly Sales Trends
- There's a **clear sales peak in December**, followed by a sharp **drop in January** ‚Äî textbook seasonal pattern tied to holiday shopping and post-season slowdown.
- Sales rebuild slowly through Q1, implying a good time to test new product categories or pricing strategies in off-peak periods.

### üíµ Price vs. Quantity Relationship
- Products priced under $500 dominate volume sales. There's a **visible decline in quantity ordered as price increases**, though a few expensive items still sell well.
- This indicates a **threshold of price sensitivity** that should be considered for bundling and upsell strategies.

### üîÑ Product Association Insights
- Several product pairs are frequently ordered together ‚Äî particularly **laptops and accessories**, and **smartphones with chargers/cases**.
- These associations create a strong case for **pre-built bundles** or cross-selling placements.

## Business Recommendations

### üéØ Geo-Targeted Promotions
- Prioritize inventory allocation and marketing spend in SF, LA, and NYC ‚Äî especially during Q4.
- Offer regional discounts in price-sensitive cities to test demand elasticity.

### üßÆ Inventory Optimization
- Maintain deeper stock for top-performing SKUs across peak cities.
- Introduce limited inventory in slower-moving cities to test new item performance without overstocking.

### üí° Smarter Pricing Strategy
- Consider introducing tiered pricing or bundle discounts for items priced over $500 to increase conversion.
- Use sales velocity and price sensitivity curves to guide markdown schedules.

### üß† Enhanced Cross-Selling
- Promote high-frequency item pairs as bundles.
- Use email marketing or cart recommendations to surface related accessories at checkout.

## Conclusion
This case study demonstrates not only how data can inform tactical retail decisions ‚Äî but also how close analysis of geography, seasonality, pricing, and purchasing behavior can support strategic allocation decisions. The skills and logic applied here are directly transferable to real-world merchandising, allocation, and planning roles.
